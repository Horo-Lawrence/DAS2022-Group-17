## Group 17 DAS Project 2

This repository is created by Group 17 for DAS Project 2.

### Dataset

- **country** – Country of origin
- **points** – The number of points awarded for the wine on a scale of 1-100 (although reviews
are only posted for ratings 80 and above)
- **price** – The cost for a bottle of wine
- **province** – The province or state the wine is from
- title – The title of the wine review
- **variety** – The type of grape
- winery – The winery that made the wine

Then in order to study which properties will affect points to be above 90, we added a variable called 'class', which will be 'splendid' if points above 90 and 'normal' if points below 90
