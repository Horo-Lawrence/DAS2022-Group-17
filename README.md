## Group 17 DAS Project 2

This repository is created by Group 17 for DAS Project 2.

### Dataset

- **country** – Country of origin.   Categorical Variable
- **points** – The number of points awarded for the wine on a scale of 1-100 (although reviews
are only posted for ratings 80 and above)
- **price** – The cost for a bottle of wine
- **province** – The province or state the wine is from       Categorical Variable
- title – The title of the wine review
- **variety** – The type of grape          Categorical Variable
- winery – The winery that made the wine

Then in order to study which properties will affect points to be above 90, we added a variable called 'class', which will be 'splendid' if points above 90 and 'normal' if points below 90

- **class** - binary variable:'splendid' when points above 90; 'normal' when points below 90


Thus the task is to research on the relationship between 'class' and 'price', 'country', 'province' and 'variety'.

### Clean Data

When observing the dataset, we found some of values of variables have too few samples to conduct analysis. Thus when did the explanatory and formal analysis, we decided to remove these observations.

### Explanatory Analysis

Create bar chart or summary table for each variable.

### Formal Analysis

Build models between class and other variables to find the properties that affect points above 90.
